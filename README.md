I'm a data extraction specialist and freelance web scraper passionate about automating data collection, making insights more accessible, and helping businesses leverage web data efficiently.

With expertise in Python, Selenium, Scrapy, and Apify, I build custom solutions for web scraping, data mining, and API integrations. I have experience extracting structured data from various platforms, including LinkedIn, Google Maps, e-commerce stores, job boards, and social media.

On Upwork, I provide high-quality web scraping and automation scripts, ensuring accurate and scalable data extraction for clients. Additionally, I develop and sell custom Apify actors to help businesses automate their web data workflows.

My goal is to deliver efficient, ethical, and maintainable scraping solutions while staying updated with the latest anti-bot techniques, including proxy rotation, captchas, and user-agent spoofing.
